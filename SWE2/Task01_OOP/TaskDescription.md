# Description
Classes and Objects

Created a base class Car that represents a general car.
Created objects from derived classes in the main function.
Encapsulation

Used private data members (brand, year) inside the Car class.
Provided public setter and getter methods to control access to data.
Inheritance

Derived three classes from Car:
ElectricCar
GasCar
HybridCar
Polymorphism

Declared the start() function as a pure virtual function in the base class.
Overrode the start() function in each derived class to provide different behavior based on the car type.
Abstraction

Used an abstract class (Car) to define a common interface for all car types.
Program Flow:

Objects of different car types are created (ElectricCar, GasCar, HybridCar).
Car information such as brand and year is displayed using the showInfo() method.
