# Reflection

### What I learned
I learned the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming using C++. I understood how to design a base class and derive multiple subclasses from it. I learned how encapsulation works by using private data members with public getters and setters. I also learned how polymorphism allows different classes to provide their own implementation of the same function using virtual and overridden methods.

### What was challenging
- Deciding which actors are external vs internal.

### What I improved
- Better naming conventions and system boundary understanding.
