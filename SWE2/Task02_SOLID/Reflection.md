# Reflection
### What I learned 
What I learned: I learned how to apply SOLID principles in C++ using a practical example. I understood how separating responsibilities improves code readability and maintainability. I also learned how interfaces can be used to avoid forcing classes to implement unnecessary methods. This task helped me see how abstraction and polymorphism make the system easy to extend without modifying existing code.
### What was challenging
I encountered many mistakes, but I tried to resolve them as best I could.

### What I improved
We can improve this code
