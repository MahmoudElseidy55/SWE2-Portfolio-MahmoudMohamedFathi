# Final Project Description
This final project was implemented using C++ programming language.
The main goal of the project was to demonstrate practical applications of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, SOLID principles, and common Design Patterns in a single extended scenario.

Key Concepts and Features Implemented:
OOP Concepts:

Classes and inheritance: Car, ElectricCar, GasCar, HybridCar
Polymorphism: start() method overridden in different car types
Abstract classes and interfaces: Car as abstract base, IRechargeable interface
Encapsulation: private and protected attributes
Design Patterns Used:

Singleton: Logger class ensures only one instance for logging
Factory: BeverageFactory creates different beverage types (Coffee, Tea)
Builder: BeverageBuilder adds extras and builds beverages step by step
Decorator: MilkDecorator adds additional functionality to beverages
Observer: Cafe notifies Customer observers when orders are placed
Scenario Implemented:

Three clients (Ahmed, Hoda, mohamed) interact with cars and beverages
Cars can start and recharge if applicable (electric and hybrid)
Beverages are created dynamically using builder and decorator patterns
Cafe notifies observers of each client’s beverage order
Goals Achieved:
Demonstrated integration of multiple design patterns in a real-world scenario
Applied SOLID principles for clean and maintainable code
Practiced dynamic memory management in C++
Showcased interaction between different modules in a modular and extendable system
This project combines practical C++ programming, software design principles, and design pattern implementation to create a flexible and maintainable software architecture.
