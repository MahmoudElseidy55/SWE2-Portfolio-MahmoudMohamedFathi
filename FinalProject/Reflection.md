What I learned:
I learned how to apply SOLID principles together with design patterns in a real project.
I understood how each SOLID principle helps in writing cleaner, more maintainable code,
and how design patterns solve recurring design problems efficiently.
I also practiced designing classes, interfaces, and their interactions systematically,
which improved my overall software design skills.

What was challenging:
Designing a flexible architecture that correctly follows SOLID principles
was challenging, especially making sure that changes in one module
would not break other modules. Balancing the use of design patterns
with simplicity of the code was another challenge, as it is easy
to overcomplicate the system if not careful.

 What I improved:
My understanding of software design and architecture improved significantly.
I became more confident in applying design patterns in real scenarios,
and I learned how to write modular, reusable, and scalable code.
This project also improved my problem-solving skills and my ability
to plan and structure code before starting to write it.
